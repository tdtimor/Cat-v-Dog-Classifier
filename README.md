# Cat v Dog Classifier
 A binary classifier using keras to distinguish between a cat and a dog. 
 The model uses two convolution layers with relu activation functions. 
 It gives the accuracy of 96.5% on training data but only 65.25% on test data. 
 This could be increased by using a bigger data set.
